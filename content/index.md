## Patterns
Reusable engineering patterns across all apps.
- [[correlation-id]] -- Track execution across services and logs.
- [[idempotency-guard]] -- Status gate prevents duplicate processing.
- [[error-handling]] -- Catch errors, log them, write status back to source record.
- [[config-driven-routing]] -- Routing logic in config records, not code.
- [[mock-data-strategy]] -- Mock toggle for external APIs without sandboxes.
- [[pre-release-checklist]] -- Every production release gate.
- [[cloudflare-pages-deploy]] -- Deploy static sites to CF Pages with auto project limit management.
- [[websocket-progress-pattern]] -- Real-time pipeline progress via WebSocket broadcast.
- [[inline-editor-pattern]] -- Post-generation editing with live iframe preview + rebuild.
- [[act-learn-reuse-testing]] -- Self-improving test loop: run, extract failures, feed knowledge back.
- [[scout-build-verify]] -- Three-agent workflow: scout analyzes, builder implements, verifier validates.

## Decisions
Architectural decisions with rationale.
- [[karpathy-wiki-comparison]] -- LLM Wiki vs Clarity. Gaps, advantages, bridge plan.
- [[multi-format-ingest-strategy]] -- Config-driven + AI hybrid for normalizing data formats.
